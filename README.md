11. Name the Commit Submission for Lab 1 and write a note to explain what you did. These notes are very important as they help you remember what you changed on a given commit. Click Commit to main to commit the changes

12. Once a commit has been made the final step is to push that commit. Up until this point you have only changed the local repository. Once you push then the changes will also be reflected in the online repository. Click Push Origin.

13. When you return to GitHub you will now see your commit. Clicking on the commit you will be able to see the details of what was changed in that commit.
